**<h1 align = center >BATTLE SHIP</h1>**
### Welcome to my newest game, Battle Ship! This is Version 1 of many versions. I am excited to share my work with the world and to see how it changes and evolves over time. Thank you for joining me on this journey. This game was designed with html, css, and javascript, and is a turn based Javascript dom game. It was created by G-vision studios by me Gobi. In this game, you will be able to play against the computer. We hope you enjoy playing! Amazing updates coming soon!


##Technoligies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
4. GIT PAGES

##Getting Started
1. A gitpages link located at the bottom of this readme will allow you to go to the game's web address.
2. The Ai has already set up the pieces, the peices are color coded and not hidden, for learning and presentation purposes.
3. Both the player and the computer team have five ships with sizes ranging from 2 to 6.
4.	As soon as you make your very first choice for each ship, you can then either opt to select the square in the vertical region of the square attached to your first ship, or else choose the square attached to the horizontal part of that same square. You then need to advance by the length of the ships selected.
5. Once you plot all 6 ships, you can try out the spaces on the computer side. 
6. Red miss indicates a miss, and an orange hit signifies a success.
7. Continue to play the game until you or the computer hits all the ships.
8. Whichever side is able to destory all of the battleShips first is victorious.
